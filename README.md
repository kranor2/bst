# bst

This is my eleventh project within the Full Stack JavaScript course from The Odin Project, continuing my coursework within the JavaScript chapter of the course. This project responds to the prompt wherein students are challenged to create a class/factory each for Node and Tree with attributes for the data it stores, plus methods on the Tree class/factory which enable users to balance/rebalance, traverse (in various level orders), and manipulate a Binary Search Tree. This project continues to develop knowledge in data structures, algorithms, time/space complexity, and binary search trees, implementing this knowledge as an opportunity to practice considering the most efficient method to achieve functionality and effectively manipulate data/structures within a given context. Unlike with the Linked List project, I chose not to implement modules in this project, but I know that this project itself can be a module implemented into later projects requiring the management of data within a Binary Search Tree.

In another attempt, I might have created a separate module for the Tree class/factory, leaving bst.js to be the code wherein the Tree can be created, traversed, and/or manipulated more efficiently.
